# Spotify-Playlist-Updater
This code updates the title and description after policy takedowns. It runs for at least 1 hour, if your connection is stable it will run much longer. The script automatically opens a spotify authorization link to refresh an authorization token. When an exception occurs that stops the main script the second script will restart the main one. The script will not stop so long as your phone has power or quit the program.
